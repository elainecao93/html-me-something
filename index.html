    <h2>To be fair</h2>
        <p><img class="para" src="images/1-rnm.jpg">you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of 
            theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly 
            woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans 
            understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're 
            not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course 
            they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a 
            cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated 
            simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. 
            how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚</p>
        <p>And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they 
            have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž</p>

    <h2>What the fuck</h2>
        <h3>did you just fucking say to me,</h3>
        <h4>you little bitch?</h4>
        <p><img class="para" src="images/3-navyseal.jpg">I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and 
            I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are 
            nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on 
            this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. 
            As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare 
            for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be 
            anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively 
            trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full 
            extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy 
            retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you 
            couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. 
            You're fucking dead, kiddo.</p>

    <h2>A liberal Muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor</h2>
        <p>and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist</p>
        <p>"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world 
            has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!"</p>
        <p>At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of 
            war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.</p>
        <p>"How old is this rock?"</p>
        <p>The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied "4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian"</p>
        <p>"Wrong. Itâ€™s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is realâ€¦ then it 
            should be an animal now"</p>
        <p>The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those 
            liberal crocodile tears.</p>
        <p>The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named "Small 
            Government" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read 
            several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.</p>
        <p>The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for 
            all eternity.</p>
        <p>Semper Fi</p>

    <h2>Did you ever hear the story of</h2>
        <p><img class="para" src="images/4-darth.jpg">Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord 
            of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a 
            knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to 
            many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which 
            eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his 
            sleep. Ironic, he could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
